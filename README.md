1.	Time Series Analysis:
*	Analyzed trends in oil, water, and gas production over time.
*	Detected any seasonality or cyclic behavior in production or injection rates.
2.	Spatial Analysis:
*	Plotted the wells on a map using the Surface X & Surface Y coordinates to visualize their spatial distribution.
*	Analyzed if there are any spatial patterns or clusters in production or injection rates.
3.	Correlation Analysis:
*	Determined if there's a correlation between different variables, such as between oil production and water injection rates.
4.	Well Performance Analysis:
*	Identified the top-performing wells in terms of oil, water, or gas production.
*	Analyzed the performance of wells over their lifetime.
5.	Predictive Modeling:
*	Built model to forecast future production rates based on historical data.
6.	Optimization:
*	Determined the optimal water or gas injection rates to maximize oil production.
*	Suggest optimal drilling locations based on spatial patterns and historical performance.
7.	Anomaly Detection:
*	Detected any anomalies or unexpected behaviors in production or injection rates, which might indicate equipment failures or other issues.
8.	Comparison Analysis:
*	Compared the performance of injector wells vs. producer wells.
*	Analyzed how different wells respond to changes in bottomhole pressure.
9.	Trend Identification:
*	Identified any declining or increasing trends in production or injection rates which can help in planning future operations.
